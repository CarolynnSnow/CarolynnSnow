Hi, this is Carolynn Snow(2 'n's, please!) and I'm currently learning Python and just coding in general. 
My hobbies are reading, playing computer games, hugging rabbits and coding(sort of). 
To reach me, just email carolynnsnow@gmail.com . I don't check that email, though, so I will probably never reply,or even see your email, which is just as well, because if you're looking for my contcts here, you probably aren't someone I know.
Yeah, so that's pretty much all. Bye, and see you never!
